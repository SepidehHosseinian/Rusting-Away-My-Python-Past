# Rusting Away My Python Past: A Journey into Speed and Safety
Welcome, fellow escapees from the Python jungle!  This repository chronicles my quest to shed the skin of my Python past and embrace the power and efficiency of Rust.

## Why Rust?

Blazing-fast performance: Say goodbye to sluggish interpreters and hello to lightning-speed compilation. ⚡️

Memory magic: Ditch the garbage collector and master the art of manual memory management. ‍♀️

Safety first: No more dangling pointers or cryptic runtime errors. ️
A new frontier: Explore a world of advanced language features and paradigms. ️

## What you'll find here:

Code snippets and tutorials: Learn from my triumphs and tribulations as I tackle Rust challenges, big and small. ‍♀️
Project breakdowns: Witness the evolution of my Rust skills through real-world projects. ️
Python PTSD flashbacks (optional): Okay, maybe not. But expect some humorous comparisons and shared experiences.
A community of Rust renegades: Share your code, ask questions, and support each other on this exciting journey.

## Getting started: ️

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/SepidehHosseinian/Rusting-Away-My-Python-Past.git

Install Rust and Cargo: Follow the official instructions at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Build specific projects: Each project will have its own README with instructions.

Join the fun! Don't hesitate to contribute, ask questions, and share your own Rust experiences.

Remember, this is just the beginning. The code might be rough around the edges, and the borrower checker might be a beast, but the rewards are worth it. Together, we can rust away our Python pasts and build a future of blazing-fast, memory-efficient, and awesomely safe code!

## Tech Stack:
